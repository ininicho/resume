% To whom it may concern,
% 
% I am submitting my candidature for the {\position} position at {\company}.
% My passion is to work with extremely talented people and collaborate to make
% an immediate impact. I am currently in my third year in university studying
% Data Science, and I am keen to further pursue my career in this field through
% this internship. Working at {\company} will expand my ability to solve real 
% world problems with data.
% 
% In my previous internship at Farmlink Solutions, I worked with the team in building
% a client-facing web application. As a full-stack developer, I had the opportunity to
% work closely on both frontend and backend. I gained experience in developing the client
% facing interface using the Vue.js framework with Vuetify. I was also responsible in
% refactoring the database models to optimize backend queries and implemeting business
% logic in the existing Django code. Aside from writing code, I did plenty of unit testing
% and code reviewing throughout the internship.
% 
% I also have experience in data analysis gained from my studies and side projects. I have
% some experience in using some data science libraries such as numpy, pandas and TensorFlow.
% I hope that my expertice would make me a great addition to your team.
% 
% Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward
% to hopefully meeting with you in the future to further discuss my
% qualifications for a position as {\positionPreposition} {\position} at {\company}
% this upcoming winter term. If you have any questions, please feel free to
% email me at \href{mailto:nsuprapt@uwaterloo.ca}{nsuprapt@uwaterloo.ca} or
% call me at \href{tel:+1-437-986-7810}{437-986-7810}.
